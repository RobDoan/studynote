- Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located in another computer on a network without having to understand the network's details. A procedure call is also sometimes known as a function call or a subroutine call.
- An RPC is a **synchronous operation** requiring the requesting program to be suspended until the results of the remote procedure are returned.
