# Topic Modeling

Clustering is group similar dataset to separate groups. Topic modeling refers dataset to several topics.

Example:
  - Clustering group similar news to a group which may talk about a problems
  - Topic model: "This book is about Python and Machine Learning" so that it will refer this book to "Python" topic and "Machine Learning" topic.

Topic model will be able to answers question:
  - What is it __about__?
  - What is it __related to__?
  - What is it __feel like__?

Topics will be identified automatically from a collection of text documents.

[__LDA(latent Dirichlet allocation)__][latent-dirichlet-allocation] vs __LDA(linear discriminant analysis)__ are 2 methods in machine learning.
However __LDA(latent Dirichlet allocation)__ is topic modeling method, and
__LDA(linear discriminant analysis)__ is a classification method. They are completely unrelated.

__hierarchical Dirichlet process__ is a method which will automatically determine the number of topics for you.

We could research more on methods:
  - The Indian buffet process
  - Pachinko allocation
